MelaNoMore serves as a **"second set of eyes"** for dermatologists during clinical examinations:

1. **Pre-screening** happens instantly on the handheld device, even offline
2. **Suspicious cases** are automatically escalated to a more powerful model running on a server
3. **Detailed classification** helps dermatologists make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment

This workflow helps:
- ⏱️ Save time during patient consultations
- 🔍 Reduce diagnostic errors
- 🩺 Improve early detection of dangerous skin cancers like melanoma

## 🏗️ System Architecture

MelaNoMore employs a **two-tier classification system**:

### Tier 1: Edge Device (Arduino Nicla Vision)
- **Model**: `fai-cls-n-coco` (Focoos AI)
- **Task**: Binary classification (suspicious vs. non-suspicious)
- **Input**: 96x96 RGB images
- **Inference**: Real-time, on-device
- **Output**: Classification + LED feedback

### Tier 2: Server (PC/Cloud)
- **Model**: Vision Transformer Large (ViT-L/16)
- **Task**: Multi-class classification across 7 lesion types
- **Parameters**: ~305M
- **Inference**: Triggered only for suspicious cases
- **Output**: Detailed classification with confidence scores

### Communication Flow

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Clinical Workflow

1. **Position Device**
   - Hold the MelaNoMore device over the patient's skin lesion
   - **Yellow LED** indicates positioning mode
   - ToF sensor ensures correct distance (3-5 cm)

2. **Capture Image**
   - Once positioned correctly, **Blue LED** activates
   - Image is automatically captured

3. **On-Device Classification**
   - Nicla Vision runs binary classification
   - **Green LED** = Non-suspicious (Done)
   - **Red LED** = Suspicious (Image uploaded to server)

4. **Server Analysis** (for suspicious cases only)
   - Image automatically transmitted via WiFi
   - Vision Transformer performs detailed 7-class classification
   - Results appear on web dashboard

5. **Review Results**
   - Dermatologist reviews detailed classification on PC dashboard
   - Prediction includes lesion type and confidence scores
   - Clinical decision made based on AI recommendation + medical expertise
